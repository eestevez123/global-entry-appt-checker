## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Local Setup)

### 1. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv       # Create virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate   # Activate it (use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt # install required python libraries for this project
```

To deactivate:
```bash
deactivate
```

### 2. Creating a .env file locally
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

```dotenv
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
TO_EMAIL=recipient_email@gmail.com
ALERTS_ENABLED=true
```

`ALERTS_ENABLED` is used to control whether you would like email notification about earlier appointments found compared to threshold date

For help getting your app password if you are using G-mail, I suggest following this video: [How To Set Up Gmail SMTP Server - Full Guide
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfEK3WP73eY).

These environment variables will need to be created and set when deploying this code.

### 3. Run Locally

#### Testing Email Sending Locally
Once you set up your .env file, run the following command: `python3 test_send_email.py`

You will know you have the correct values once you receive the test email in your inbox

Use `python3 app.py` to run the actual application. The default port is 3005, but this can be modified.

### üõ°Ô∏è Keep It Alive with UptimeRobot

On Render‚Äôs free tier, your app may go to sleep without traffic.

To keep it alive:
- Sign up at [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)
- Create a monitor that pings: https://your-app-name.onrender.com/health (change this according to what you named your project). This triggers your `/health` endpoint and keeps the scheduler running.
